This repository is a test repository to learn very basic facts about climate change and
to create a whole Github workflow around it. There is at the moment only one file
which implements the radiation balance. The source is the turorial The climate Laboratory by Brian E. J. Rose
and it can be found on https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/home.html. The
implementation language is Python 3 "[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)".
