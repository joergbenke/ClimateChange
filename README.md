This repository is a test repository to learn very basic facts about climate change and
to create a whole Github workflow around it. There is at the moment only one file
which implements the radiation balance. The source is the tutorial [The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/home.html) by Brian E. J. Rose and the implementation language is Python 3.
